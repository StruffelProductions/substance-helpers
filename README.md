# ambientCG substance tools
This repository contains useful new nodes for **Adobe Substance 3D Designer** which you can import and use in your own projects. Most of them are made by me while working on assets for [ambientCG](https://ambientCG.com).

## Installation
1. Start by downloading the content of this repository using GIT or by clicking on **Code** -> **Download ZIP** in the browser.

2. Extract the ZIP archive into a location where it won't get in the way (it needs to stay in that place permanently).
3. Open Substance 3D Designer and navigate to **Edit** -> **Preferences**.
